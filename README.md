# Cartridge Prototype Shield
This Arduino Mega 2560 shield is basically just a PCI slot with headers attached to them for prototyping dumping, writing, and doing other stuff with different kinds of cartridges. I was inspired by [this dumper](https://team-europe.blogspot.com/2020/07/preserving-games-anybody-can-now-do-it.html) by TeamEurope, and I wanted to dump some cartridges for the Vtech Mobigo and InnoTab, but the issue is, TeamEurope's been a bit AWOL recently and that board doesn't even dump InnoTab cartridges. I wanted to design my own board, but was worried I would get it wrong and have to get a new one. So instead, I just designed a board with a bunch of headers so that I can not only make sure I get it right, but also utilize it for other boards that fit that slot.![3D_PCB2_1_2025-01-17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86ccaf06-cce4-4129-bb6d-82fe7696b3d5)
